Circle Creation Program

This Python script, circle_creation.py, is designed to create and display a simple image with a circle using the OpenCV library. The script utilizes NumPy, OpenCV, and Matplotlib for image processing and visualization.

Description

The script creates a black and white image (im2) with a white circle at the center. The circle's radius is set to half the minimum dimension of the image (length or width). The resulting image is displayed using Matplotlib.

Code Explanation

Test Array: The script starts by creating a black image (im2) using NumPy.

Circle Creation: The script calculates the radius as half the minimum dimension of the image and iterates through each pixel. Pixels outside the defined circle are set to white (255).

Display: The script displays the resulting image using Matplotlib.

Note: Code for displaying images using OpenCV is commented out as it may not work directly in a Colab environment.

Dependencies
NumPy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
Google Colab (for display in Colab environment)
